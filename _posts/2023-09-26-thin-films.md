$$Abstract$$

>This paper presents a comprehensive investigation on
the fabrication and characterization of titanium-doped indium-tin-
oxide (ITO) thin films. The fabrication process involved the use of
a sputtering system, followed by annealing at elevated temperatures
in a furnace, resulting in the production of eight distinct samples.
In order to comprehend the optical properties of each sample, UV-
Vis absorption measurements were conducted. Moreover, Tauc and
Urbach plots were generated to determine the band gap and Urbach
energies, respectively.

# Background

This was a part of research grant in my university called UXplore, where students get matched with researcher to work on a project. I was responsible for fabricating and characterizing the thin films, and analyzing the optical properties of the thin films.
