# Master of Science in Quantum Computing

Course resources and materials for the graduate quantum computing program @ KFUPM. I will be adding resources as I go. Starting this semester with ICS 560 & PHYS 512.

## 251 General Material

Foundational resources for Term 1 students covering both ICS 560 and PHYS 512:

### Mathematical Foundations
- [**Dirac Notation Guide**](/assets/resources/dirac_notation_qc_guide.pdf) - Essential notation system for quantum computing
- [**Complex Numbers Reference**](/assets/resources/complex_numbers_qc_reference.pdf) - Core arithmetic, Euler's formula, quantum gates phases, and Bloch sphere representation

### Course Overview
- [**Week 1 Summary**](/assets/resources/CohortSummaryTerm%231.pdf) - Comprehensive overview and key concepts for both courses

## Recommended Resources
