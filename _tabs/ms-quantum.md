# Master of Science in Quantum Computing

Course resources and materials for the graduate quantum computing program @ KFUPM. I will be adding resources as I go. Starting this semester with ICS 560 & PHYS 512.

## Recommended Resources

### Foundational Text (Beginner to Intermediate)

**[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information)** by Michael Nielsen & Isaac Chuang  
Often referred to as "Mike and Ike," this is the standard textbook in quantum information science. With over 58,000 citations, it provides a comprehensive introduction assuming minimal prior knowledge of quantum mechanics or computer science. Covers fundamental topics including quantum circuits, quantum algorithms (Fourier transform, search), quantum noise, error correction, and information theory. Essential for building a strong theoretical foundation.

### Hardware and Implementation (Intermediate to Advanced)

**[A Quantum Engineer's Guide to Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560)** by Krantz et al. (2019)  
An introductory guide bridging fundamental concepts with contemporary applications in quantum computing. Reviews 20 years of evolution from basic research to engineering large-scale quantum systems. Covers superconducting circuit design, qubit control, readout techniques, noise properties, and circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Ideal for understanding the hardware implementation of quantum computers.

**[Introduction to Experimental Quantum Measurement with Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09291)** by Mahdi Naghiloo (2019)  
A pedagogical introduction to quantum measurement in superconducting systems, exploring the dynamics of single qubits under continuous monitoring. Covers experimental quantum dynamics, quantum thermodynamics, and weak measurement techniques. Provides an in-depth experimental perspective essential for those working with physical quantum systems.

### Practical Applications (Advanced)

**[Practical Introduction to Benchmarking and Characterization of Quantum Computers](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.6.030202)** by Hashim et al. (2025)  
A comprehensive tutorial on quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV) tools. Designed for both newcomers and experts, it provides essential techniques to evaluate and enhance quantum computing performance. Critical for understanding how to assess the quality and reliability of quantum computations in practice.
