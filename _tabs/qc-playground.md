# Quantum Circuit Playground

Interactive quantum circuit simulator powered by [Q.js](https://quantumjavascript.app). Build, visualize, and experiment with quantum circuits directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Text-based circuit editor** - Write quantum circuits using Q.js's intuitive syntax
- **Visual circuit diagrams** - See your circuits rendered as interactive diagrams
- **Probability analysis** - View measurement outcomes and quantum state probabilities
- **Export options** - Generate ASCII diagrams, LaTeX code, and plain text representations
- **Sample circuits** - Learn from pre-built examples including Bell states and quantum algorithms

## Getting Started

1. Type or paste your quantum circuit in the text area below
2. Click "Apply" to render the circuit and see results
3. Experiment with the sample circuits provided
4. Export your circuits for use in documentation or presentations

Start with something simple like a Bell state:
```
H-X#0
I-X#1
```

Or try the loaded example circuit to see how entanglement works!
