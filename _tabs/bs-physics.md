# Bachelor of Science in Physics

This page is following the course-naming and standards of KFUPM, but could still be useful for most physics students. I chose to only include only 300-400 level courses, as true physics only begins from there.

The resources for most courses can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112c4AD_0ECN9g5z-LwjSxJpzi0Wf3Dnv), courtesy to [Mohammed AL-Saif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-al-saif-70b652171/).
