# Course Resources Migration Plan - REVISED
## Level 300 & 400 Courses from tmp/ to assets/resources/

---

## Overview
This plan details the migration of course resources from the `tmp/` folder to the organized `assets/resources/` structure, with standardized naming conventions and proper categorization.

## Important Notes
- **Textbooks under 100MB will be INCLUDED** (not skipped)
- **MUST CHECK existing course resources** to determine if homework files are questions or solutions
- **Will READ files during execution** to properly identify and name solution files

## Files to Skip (>100MB ONLY)
- `/tmp/Level#3 - Junior/Physics#300/Numerical Homework/Dr.Saeed Workshop for Mathematica.mp4` (230MB - video file)
- `/tmp/Physics#xxx/PHYS#373/PHYS 373.zip` (124MB - compressed file)

---

## Implementation Process

### Critical Step: File Content Verification
**During execution (not now), I will:**
1. **READ each homework/quiz/exam file** to determine if it contains solutions
2. **COMPARE with existing files** in assets/resources to avoid duplicates
3. **NAME files appropriately:**
   - If it's a solution: `HW1_Solution.pdf`
   - If it's just questions: `HW1.pdf`
   - If both exist: Keep both with clear naming

## New Courses to Create

1. **PHYS 305** - Electricity & Magnetism I (Core - Level 300)
2. **PHYS 306** - Electricity & Magnetism II (Core - Level 300)
3. **PHYS 308** - Electronics (Elective - Level 300)
4. **PHYS 423** - Physics of Nuclear Reactors (Elective - Level 400)
5. **PHYS 432** - Introduction to Solid State Physics (Elective - Level 400)

---

## Execution Steps

1. **For each course:**
   - READ existing files in assets/resources to understand current content
   - READ new files from tmp/ to identify if they contain solutions
   - Compare to avoid duplicates
   - Name appropriately based on actual content

2. **Naming Convention:**
   - Questions only: `HW1.pdf`, `Quiz1.pdf`
   - Solutions only: `HW1_Solution.pdf`, `Quiz1_Solution.pdf`
   - Both in one file: `HW1_with_Solutions.pdf`
   - Unclear content: READ file first, then decide

3. **File Size Check:**
   - Skip ONLY files >100MB
   - Include ALL textbooks <100MB
   - Include ALL PDFs <100MB

---

## Summary of Changes from Previous Plan

1. âœ… **Include textbooks under 100MB** (previously skipped at 50MB+)
2. âœ… **Must READ files** to determine if they contain solutions
3. âœ… **Check existing files** before adding to avoid duplicates
4. âœ… **Explicit naming** based on actual content, not just filename

This approach ensures accurate categorization and prevents mislabeling of homework solutions vs. questions.
