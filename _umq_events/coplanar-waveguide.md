  Resonators are fundamental components in superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit readout, photon storage, and coherent qubit-qubit coupling in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Among the two main types—lumped element and coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators—CPWs offer better frequency control, reduced parasitics, and straightforward 50 Ω integration. This seminar focuses on CPW resonators and their practical integration with qubits, emphasizing key design parameters such as coupling capacitance, external quality factor, and mode frequency. We base our discussion on the foundational design framework established by Göppl et al., and extend it to practical implementation using HFSS, COMSOL, or Maxwell 3D to extract capacitance matrices, control cross-talk, and ensure accurate frequency and quality factor targeting in quantum processors.
