  Superconducting circuits are a rich platform to stabilize and control quantum states of microwave photons with rapid progress in applications related to quantum computing. However, current noisy devices require improvements by orders of magnitude to realize the full potential of quantum algorithms. Therefore, in my PhD, I focused on improving the materials used in those circuits, and to novel schemes of encoding and manipulating quantum information. More specifically, I have been working on the Kerr-Cat qubit which is a noise-biased qubit realized by applying a squeeze drive (i.e. a two-photon drive) to a Kerr-nonlinear oscillator. In this talk I will present the progress we made with the Kerr-cat as well as new directions to harness 4-wave mixing processes for novel operations in the transmon qubit.
