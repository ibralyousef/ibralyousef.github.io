  Current-generation quantum devices are known as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines—a term coined by John Preskill. While we have made progress in engineering quantum systems, they remain fundamentally limited by systematic and stochastic noise. In this UMQ session, we will explore why understanding and mitigating noise is central to the development of superconducting quantum devices. We will discuss:
  • Modeling errors in qubits
  • Various decoherence mechanisms in superconducting circuits
  • The impact of materials on coherence
  • Current strategies for noise mitigation
